        Standing on the white marble steps of the Silvane Estate, Anton watched Zyllana stride wordlessly away from the
        group with her customary grace. He glanced at Faelthys, who returned his questioning gaze with a curt nod. Anton
        sighed internally again, his brow furrowing as he considered the wisdom of the Elven Monk's actions. Zyllana had
        long since earned Anton's trust and respect in many matters, and he hoped the reverse was also true. However,
        though he admitted their effectiveness, he could not deny an uneasiness which settled in his stomach whenever
        she met with her 'contacts'. Anton had learned personally to be wary of those who sell secrets; allegiance to
        their clients was rarely their chief concern.
      </p>

      <p>
        His wariness became surprise, however, when Faelthys announced that he would also be joining the meeting.
        Zyllana had never invited anyone to come along, her preference for working alone clear from the beginning. Anton
        was also surprised to find that his reaction was tinged with jealousy. Why should Faelthys be privy to the inner
        workings of this secretive group? The thought was quickly quashed - no need to be jealous of something you don't
        want in the first place. So lost in thought was the young archaeologist that it was several times Ilro called
        his name before he realised.
      </p>

      <p>'Sorry, what? I was thinking.' he said.</p>

      <p>'Careful, don't hurt yourself.', smirked Ilro, 'I said, what are we going to do while they're gone?'</p>

      <p>
        Anton did not respond for a few moments, his eyes watching Faelthys' coat tails whip around the corner. Shaking
        himself, he fixed a smile on his face and wrapped his arm around his companion. 'Follow me.'

          <SubTitle>Baldur's Gate</SubTitle>
          <p>
            The man's breath came in ragged gasps, the air seeming reluctant to fill his lungs. His voice was a rushed
            whisper - leather sliding along silk. He was a study in motionless self-control, but his eyes belied a
            deep-seated readiness, every muscle coiled ready to strike at the click of a boot or the swish of a cape. It
            was an attitude the two wood elves knew well; no-one liked surprises.
          </p>

          <p>
            'Bryad', rasped the voice, 'His name is Bryad. He watches the Southern Gate. Most of his guard don't bother
            to keep an eye out, or an ear. But Bryad's different.'
          </p>

          <p> 'Why?', questioned Faelthys.</p>

          <p>
            'Many guards have families, who they understandably want to protect. It's part of the reason they joined the
            guard, aside from a na√Øve sense of duty.' The man's eyes rolled back in exasperated disdain, 'But Bryad is
            different. He has a family, oh yes, but he wants more. He sees the power and the comforts of those with
            wealth, and he yearns for it. He doesn't want his legacy to remain pinned to a duty roster. I suspect he'd
            be willing to do many things for the sake of a heavier purse, or the favour of an influential individual.'
          </p>

          <p>'Has he taken bribes in the past?', this from Zyllana.</p>

          <p>
            'I know not, or you would too.' was the reply, 'But it would not surprise me. With Fortune's favour, he's on
            duty right now. For another three hours at least.'
          </p>

          <p>
            'Thank you. You've been most helpful, as always.', said Zyllana, inclining her head respectfully. The
            movement was mimicked by her two companions; the conversation was over. Anyone watching (although no-one
            uninvited would have been welcome), would have assumed to conclude with some payment, but the parties knew
            that compensation would be received in due time. A small gift arriving in the man's bedroom, or a
            particularly good offer at the local merchants for a day. Bags of coins were loud, and drew the attention of
            those with whom no-one wanted to be associated. People like Bryad.
          </p>

          <p>
            The pair made their way through the Lower City, passing merchants, peddlers, entertainers and craftsmen.
            Fumes hung thick in the air from a blacksmith's forge, mingling with the scent of freshly baked bread and
            tanning oils from the leather-makers across the square. It wasn't long before they reached CliffGate on the
            city's south-eastern road. Through the portcullis they could see the smoke rising from Tumbledown, with
            thatched roofs and iron-grey brickwork to the walls, nestled amongst the hills to the east.
          </p>

          <p>
            It didn't take long for them to find Bryad. The description they were given, along with all the Harpers'
            information, was accurate and detailed. Climbing the staircase to his post, Zyllana whispered to her
            companion, 'Let me try something.' Faelthys' face showed no sign he had heard, but he hung back a pace or so
            nevertheless.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bryad was a tall, reedy man with a messy head full of dark brown hair. His face was torn between watchful
            zealousness and indifferent boredom as the pair approached. 'Can I help you? Something wrong?'
          </p>

          <p>
            Zyllana, as ever, wasted no time. 'I'm afraid so. We're looking for a group of...travellers that came past
            this way. Individuals that would never have passed under your watchful eye, nor back out again. And yet
            somehow they did. Care to explain?'
          </p>

          <p>
            Bryad bristled. He was not used to such disrespect; his uniform saw to that. 'I don't know what you mean,
            and watch your tongue.'
          </p>

          <p>
            'Well then at least one of us would be on the lookout.' retorted Zyllana, placidly. 'Perhaps these
            individuals we seek made it worth your while? Perhaps you went home a few coins heavier that day, unless you
            spent them in the tavern over there.' Zyllana jerked her thumb over her shoulder to the building in
            question, a gaudy, raucous place. Its sign swung in the afternoon breeze, proclaiming its name as The
            Plaited Beard.
          </p>

          <p>
            'How dare you!', spat Bryad. 'I should have you locked up for making false accusations of the town guard!'
          </p>

          <p>
            'I wouldn't try, that would be embarassing for you and, more importantly, irritating for us.', came the
            reply. 'We need to find them. Where are they? Or shall we bring over your sergeant and see if they're
            anymore forthcoming?'. Zyllana's eyes glimmered with a dangerous calm, but Bryad seemed unmoved. His pride
            was stronger than his fear.
          </p>

          <p>
            'Like I said, I have no idea what you're talking about. Now piss off before <em>I</em> call the sergeant and
            have you taken away.' He turned his gaze back to the horizon with an arrogant sniff.
          </p>

          <p>Faelthys strode forward past his friend with a whisper. 'My turn.'</p>

          <p>
            Bryad didn't turn, but his eyes flickered towards Faelthys as he walked forward, before settling them back
            rigidly on the chimneytops of the nearby village.
          </p>

          <p>
            'Look, we're not here to get you into any trouble, and we don't really care about the...connections that
            you've made. We just want to know where a certain group have gone. My son, he... he was taken from me by
            wolves, two winters ago. A boy of only eight.'
          </p>

          <p>Bryad still did not look into the elve's eyes, but his face softened noticeably.</p>

          <p>
            'I won't bore you with my sob story, but all I have is his locket from when he was a baby. Someone stole it,
            and I think I know who. They went through this gate in the past few days, but that's my only lead. I have to
            find them, and before they sell it on. It's not worth much to anyone, but to me it's priceless, I'm sure you
            understand. Please, is there <em>anything</em> that you remember, or that you can tell us?'
          </p>

          <p>
            Bryad hesitated, a look of consternation shadowing his hardlined features. Eventually, he spoke. 'They're
            not far. Just near the road, half a day's ride in the forest.'
          </p>

          <p>'Thank you.' whispered Faelthys with a sigh of relief. He and Zyllana turned and strode away.</p>

          <p>
            'Do you mean to kill them?' called Bryad. The elves turned and looked at the guard. His lips were tightly
            pressed together; clearly he was only just managing to control himself.
          </p>

          <p>'Yes.' said Faelthys, simply.</p>

          <p>
            'Those bastards threatened my sister, I had no choice.' whispered the guardsman, 'Don't give them one
            either.'
          </p>

          <p>
            The pair stared levelly at the many for a few moments. After a small nod from Faelthys they strode
            wordlessly down the ramp to the town below. Behind them, the wind grasped at Bryad's tunic and silently
            wiped away the tear from his face.
          </p>
        </PartySplitSection>
        <PartySplitSection characters={["Anton", "Ilro"]}>
          <p>
            The stench of stale ale and roasting meat assaulted the pair's nostrils as they pushed through the heavy
            wooden door. The room rolled with raucous laughter, the clinking of mugs and pitchers, and the crackling of
            a large log fire occupying most of the opposite wall.
          </p>

          <p>
            The room was thick with pipe smoke, and large yellowing stains dotted the ceiling. Several wooden tables of
            varying sizes and shapes filled the room, and in the far corner a narrow, rickety staircase led up towards
            rooms for those willing to spare the coin.
          </p>

          <p>
            The right-hand wall was given exclusively to a large, polished wooden bar. Three barmaids flitted between
            patrons sitting on low, three-legged stools, and a matronly woman stood polishing tankards with a damp grey
            rag.
          </p>

          <p>
            Only a few eyes looked up as they entered; more out of habit than actual curiosity. One of the barmaids
            flashed them a polite smile and then returned to filling the goblet in her hands with a deep crimson wine
            from a large oak barrel on the countertop.
          </p>

          <p>
            'Over there.' whispered Anton, gesturing towards a round table in the corner. Five or six stout-looking Hill
            Dwarves sat around it, muscles roping their arms and legs and each with a large tankard of foaming ale in
            their hands. They were deep in heated discussion, with plenty of derisive laughter and dismissive gesturing.
          </p>

          <p>
            'Are you sure?' asked Ilro, somewhat nervously. He'd never been one for large crowds or the jostling and
            bustling of a tavern, and these dwarves looked about as rowdy as he could imagine anyone being.
          </p>

          <p>
            'When have I ever let you down?' smirked Anton, pressing a large pouch of gold into Ilro's hand. 'Take this
            and ask the barmaid for a round now and a round later.'
