        At a push from Anton, the door slid soundlessly open. Beyond it's frame lay a dimly lit, expensive-looking room.
        Ornately threaded carpet lined the floor, and the ceiling was a labyrinth of intricate marble and gold leaf,
        sparkling in the light of the waning fire crackling on the opposite wall.
      </p>
      <p>
        The walls were barely visible, hidden beyond a vast array of hand-crafted maps, wooden bookshelves and delicate
        portraiture. Every single item spoke of wealth, influence and power, as well as the immaculate care with which
        their owner treated them. Anton recognised a few of the books here and there, but the majority were beyond
        anything he had seen before. Many were in foreign tongues - Elvish, Dwarven, even Orcish and Goblin, and all
        were stacked with the utmost precision. It gave a sense of fine order to the chaos; a not unfitting theme for a
        Harper senior figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the center of the room was a large dining table, long since relegated to yet another surface for books to be
        stacked. It could have seated at least a dozen, but now there remained a solitary chair, tucked neatly in place
        in the center of the near side, a thick, leather-backed tome lovingly spread before it. Beyond, surrounding the
        fire, were two plush leather armchairs, their lining a rich merlot, and shined to perfection. Between them stood
        a small wooden side table, curiously plain and unadorned. The simplicity of this piece set it rather abruptly
        apart, and Ilro's curiosity drew him towards it, as well as the half-filled glass of cerulean liquid perched
        delicately in its centre.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I appreciate you coming on such short notice...' croaked a voice on the edges of the firelight. The voice they
        had heard not moments before.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anton, who had been immediately enamoured with the cartography plastering the walls and tables, jumped at the
        sound, turning his attention towards the fire with an embarassed sigh. Zyllana and Faelthys, meanwhile, had
        strode formally and quietly up towards the figure in the chair.
      </p>

      <p>'We were told that you needed something done.' said Zyllana matter-of-factly, 'How can we help?'</p>

      <p>
        The chuckle that replied quickly turned into a rasping cough, and Anton wondered vaguely if they should offer
        any assistance. However, his companions, even Ilro, had not moved an inch, and he thought it best not to take
        the initiative, for once.
      </p>

      <p>
        'You always were straight to business Zyllana.' muttered the voice, 'So be it.' And with this, a blanketed, pale
        hand emerged from the chair, beckoning them closer. As the group circled the other chair, their collective gaze
        took in a huddled figure, their head bent low in apparent infirmity, swaddled in thick blankets despite the heat
        of the flames beside them. On their face gleamed a silver mask, expressionless and cold. Nothing could be seen
        of the features behind it, and Ilro could hardly believe that this person was the one who had openly laughed a
        moment ago, or indeed that this was even a living creature.
      </p>

      <p>
        Syndra Silvane reached for the glass on the table besid them and shakingly raised it to their lips. Its
        contents, with no thought to conventional physics, slowly transformed into a thick smoke, which was drawn under
        the mask with a long, rattling breath. Replacing the glass once more, Syndra took another fortifying breath
        before continuing with noticeably restored strength in their voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        'By now, it can have escaped the notice of no-one that Baldur's Gate is in the grip of a terrible affliction.
        Our greatest healers are powerless to prevent those who have benefitted from resurrection succumbing to their
        diseases and wounds once more. Once the victims fall quiet, nothing can raise them again.'
      </p>

      <p>
        Anton shifted uneasily and gave a mental sigh. In the back of his mind, it was obvious that their new assignment
        would be related to the city's crisis, but he had tried to retain a shred of optimism that it might instead be
        about plundering the dungeon of some incredibly wealthy king, or charming a beautiful queen perhaps. Was that
        too much to ask?
      </p>

      <p>
        'However, thanks to <em>considerable</em> efforts from agents abroad, our months of fruitful searching for a
        cause or solution would appear to be at an end. Our organisation has learned of an ancient artifact, last
        understood to be nestled in the jungles of the Chultan Peninsula. Although known by many names, most refer to it
        as <em>The Soulmonger</em>.'
      </p>

      <p>
        Ilro risked a glance about at her companions. Normally, there would be nodding of heads or clenching of jaws at
        the mention of something so clearly important and dangerous, but hearing these words not one of them seemed to
        have heard of this artifact before; even Zyllana looked puzzled. This clearly didn't not escape Syndra's notice,
        as they chuckled quietly, and after a brief pause the rasping voice continued.
      </p>

      <p>
        'The island is a dangerous place, with few permanent settlements, and even fewer kind faces. Learning more about
        this artifact has proved...
        <em>challenging</em>. The only place with which we have had any fortune is Port Nyanzaru, on the northern coast.
        Even there our details are scarce and fleeting. The Harpers are not accustomed to being kept in the dark.' This
        last sentence muttered with just a slight hint of venom.
      </p>

      <p>'What can you tell us?' questioned Zyllana.</p>

      <p>
        'All in good time Zyllana. The waters surrounding Chult are treacherous, and would take many days to navigate.'
        Another lung-rending cough exploded from behind the mask, and it was almost a full half-minute before it was
        calmed. 'Time, it seems', said Syndra, and Anton was sure that he could hear the echoes of a bittersweet smile
        in their tones 'that we do not have.'
      </p>

      <p>
        'There are, however, other methods. I will teleport us directly to Port Nyanzaru, for you to begin a fresh
        investigation, and to find and destroy The Soulmunger. Only then can the dead finally rejoin the living once
        more. However, there is yet another obstacle before us.'
      </p>

      <p>
        'The spell requires a certain item, that should be in my possession. Sadly, it was taken by a group of bandits
        as it approached a days' ride from the Southern Gate, along with the rest of the contents of my personal
        lockbox. For a number of reasons, we need that box. Your task is to head to their camp, retrieve the box, and
        return here, using any means at your disposal.'
      </p>

      <p>'Where is this camp?', this from Faelthys, now leaning semi-casually by the fire.</p>

      <p>
        'Our sources have been too occupied to gather many details, but we believe it is no more than a day's journey
        from the Southern Gate. This is not the first time this has happened within the city, so perhaps the guard or
        local travellers may be able to assist you further with tracking down their whereabouts; and I'm sure you have
        your own resources. Do you have any more questions?'
      </p>

      <p>
        Ilro had a million questions, and even in the short time she had known them, she could see that the others did
        as well. However, it was clear that from Syndra's perspective, the conversation was over.
      </p>

      <p>
        'Good. Return to me when you have the box.' said Syndra, when no further questions were forthcoming. They made
        no movement, but it was clear that they were to show themselves out. Ilro realised for the first time that the
        butler had not followed them into the room. He also could not be seen as they retraced their steps through the
        foyer and out through into the streaming sunshine once more.
