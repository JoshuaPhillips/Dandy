        At a push from Anton, the door slid soundlessly open. Beyond it's frame
        lay a dimly lit, expensive-looking room. Ornately threaded carpet lined
        the floor, and the ceiling was a labyrinth of intricate marble and gold
        leaf, sparkling in the light of the waning fire crackling on the
        opposite wall.
      </p>
      <p>
        The walls were barely visible, hidden beyond a vast array of
        hand-crafted maps, wooden bookshelves and delicate portraiture. Every
        single item spoke of wealth, influence and power, as well as the
        immaculate care with which their owner treated them. Anton recognised a
        few of the books here and there, but the majority were beyond anything
        he had seen before. Many were in foreign tongues - Elvish, Dwarven, even
        Orcish and Goblin, and all were stacked with the utmost precision. It
        gave a sense of fine order to the chaos; a not unfitting theme for a
        Harper senior figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the center of the room was a large dining table, long since relegated
        to yet another surface for books to be stacked. It could have seated at
        least a dozen, but now there remained a solitary chair, tucked neatly in
        place in the center of the near side, a thick, leather-backed tome
        lovingly spread before it. Beyond, surrounding the fire, were two plush
        leather armchairs, their lining a rich merlot, and shined to perfection.
        Between them stood a small wooden side table, curiously plain and
        unadorned. The simplicity of this piece set it rather abruptly apart,
        and Ilro's curiosity drew him towards it, as well as the half-filled
        glass of cerulean liquid perched delicately in its centre.
      </p>
      <p>
        'I appreciate you coming on such short notice...' croaked a voice on the
        edges of the firelight. The voice they had heard not moments before.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anton, who had been immediately enamoured with the cartography
        plastering the walls and tables, jumped at the sound, turning his
        attention towards the fire with an embarassed sigh. Zyllana and
        Faelthys, meanwhile, had strode formally and quietly up towards the
        figure in the chair.
      </p>

      <p>
        'We were told that you needed something done.' said Zyllana
        matter-of-factly, 'How can we help?'
      </p>

      <p>
        The chuckle that replied quickly turned into a rasping cough, and Anton
        wondered vaguely if they should offer any assistance. However, his
        companions, even Ilro, had not moved an inch, and he thought it best not
        to take the initiative, for once.
      </p>

      <p>
        'You always were straight to business Zyllana.' muttered the voice, 'So
        be it.' And with this, a blanketed, pale hand emerged from the chair,
        beckoning them closer. As the group circled the other chair, their
        collective gaze took in a huddled figure, their head bent low in
        apparent infirmity, swaddled in thick blankets despite the heat of the
        flames beside them. On their face gleamed a silver mask, expressionless
        and cold. Nothing could be seen of the features behind it, and Ilro
        could hardly believe that this person was the one who had openly laughed
        a moment ago, or indeed that this was even a living creature.
      </p>

      <p>
        Syndra Silvane reached for the glass on the table besid them and
        shakingly raised it to their lips. Its contents, with no thought to
        conventional physics, slowly transformed into a thick smoke, which was
        drawn under the mask with a long, rattling breath. Replacing the glass
        once more, Syndra took another fortifying breath before continuing with
        noticeably restored strength in their voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        'By now, it can have escaped the notice of no-one that Baldur's Gate is
        in the grip of a terrible affliction. Our greatest healers are powerless
        to prevent those who have benefitted from resurrection succumbing to
        their diseases and wounds once more. Once the victims fall quiet,
        nothing can raise them again.'
      </p>

      <p>
        Anton shifted uneasily and gave a mental sigh. In the back of his mind,
        it was obvious that their new assignment would be related to the city's
        crisis, but he had tried to retain a shred of optimism that it might
        instead be about plundering the dungeon of some incredibly wealthy king,
        or charming a beautiful queen perhaps. Was that too much to ask?
      </p>

      <p>
        'However, thanks to <em>considerable</em> efforts from agents abroad,
        our months of fruitful searching for a cause or solution would appear to
        be at an end. Our organisation has learned of an ancient artifact, last
        understood to be nestled in the jungles of the Chultan Peninsula.
        Although known by many names, most refer to it as{" "}
        <em>The Soulmonger</em>.'
      </p>

      <p>
        Ilro risked a glance about at her companions. Normally, there would be
        nodding of heads or clenching of jaws at the mention of something so
        clearly important and dangerous, but hearing these words not one of them
        seemed to have heard of this artifact before; even Zyllana looked
        puzzled. This clearly didn't not escape Syndra's notice, as they
        chuckled quietly, and after a brief pause the rasping voice continued.
      </p>

      <p>
        'The island is a dangerous place, with few permanent settlements, and
        even fewer kind faces. Learning more about this artifact has proved...
        <em>challenging</em>. The only place with which we have had any fortune
        is Port Nyanzaru, on the northern coast. Even there our details are
        scarce and fleeting. The Harpers are not accustomed to being kept in the
        dark.' This last sentence muttered with just a slight hint of venom.
      </p>

      <p>'What can you tell us?' questioned Zyllana.</p>

      <p>
        'All in good time Zyllana. The waters surrounding Chult are treacherous,
        and would take many days to navigate.' Another lung-rending cough
        exploded from behind the mask, and it was almost a full half-minute
        before it was calmed. 'Time, it seems', said Syndra, and Anton was sure
        that he could hear the echoes of a bittersweet smile in their tones
        'that we do not have.'
      </p>

      <p>
        'There are, however, other methods. I will teleport us directly to Port
        Nyanzaru, for you to begin a fresh investigation, and to find and
        destroy The Soulmunger. Only then can the dead finally rejoin the living
        once more. However, there is yet another obstacle before us.'
      </p>

      <p>
        'The spell requires a certain item, that should be in my possession.
        Sadly, it was taken by a group of bandits as it approached a days' ride
        from the Southern Gate, along with the rest of the contents of my
        personal lockbox. For a number of reasons, we need that box. Your task
        is to head to their camp, retrieve the box, and return here, using any
        means at your disposal.'
      </p>

      <p>
        'Where is this camp?', this from Faelthys, now leaning semi-casually by
        the fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        'Our sources have been too occupied to gather many details, but we
        believe it is no more than a day's journey from the Southern Gate. This
        is not the first time this has happened within the city, so perhaps the
        guard or local travellers may be able to assist you further with
        tracking down their whereabouts; and I'm sure you have your own
        resources. Do you have any more questions?'
      </p>

      <p>
        Ilro had a million questions, and even in the short time she had known
        them, she could see that the others did as well. However, it was clear
        that from Syndra's perspective, the conversation was over.
      </p>

      <p>
        'Good. Return to me when you have the box.' said Syndra, when no further
        questions were forthcoming. They made no movement, but it was clear that
        they were to show themselves out. Ilro realised for the first time that
        the butler had not followed them into the room. He also could not be
        seen as they retraced their steps through the foyer and out through into
        the streaming sunshine once more.
