        Standing on the white marble steps of the Silvane Estate, Anton watched
        Zyllana stride wordlessly away from the group with her customary grace.
        He glanced at Faelthys, who returned his questioning gaze with a curt
        nod. Anton sighed internally again, his brow furrowing as he considered
        the wisdom of the Elven Monk's actions. Zyllana had long since earned
        Anton's trust and respect in many matters, and he hoped the reverse was
        also true. However, though he admitted their effectiveness, he could not
        deny an uneasiness which settled in his stomach whenever she met with
        her 'contacts'. Anton had learned personally to be wary of those who
        sell secrets; allegiance to their clients was rarely their chief
        concern.
      </p>

      <p>
        His wariness became surprise, however, when Faelthys announced that he
        would also be joining the meeting. Zyllana had never invited anyone to
        come along, her preference for working alone clear from the beginning.
        Anton was also surprised to find that his reaction was tinged with
        jealousy. Why should Faelthys be privy to the inner workings of this
        secretive group? The thought was quickly quashed - no need to be jealous
        of something you don't want in the first place. So lost in thought was
        the young archaeologist that it was several times Ilro called his name
        before he realised.
      </p>

      <p>'Sorry, what? I was thinking.' he said.</p>

      <p>
        'Careful, don't hurt yourself.', smirked Ilro, 'I said, what are we
        going to do while they're gone?'
      </p>

      <p>
        Anton did not respond for a few moments, his eyes watching Faelthys'
        coat tails whip around the corner. Shaking himself, he fixed a smile on
        his face and wrapped his arm around his companion. 'Follow me.'

          <p>
            The man's breath came in ragged gasps, the air seeming reluctant to
            fill his lungs. His voice was a rushed whisper - leather sliding
            along silk. He was a study in motionless self-control, but his eyes
            belied a deep-seated readiness, every muscle coiled ready to strike
            at the click of a boot or the swish of a cape. It was an attitude
            the two wood elves knew well; no-one liked surprises.
          </p>

          <p>
            'Bryad', rasped the voice, 'His name is Bryad. He watches the
            Southern Gate. Most of his guard don't bother to keep an eye out, or
            an ear. But Bryad's different.'
          </p>

          <p> 'Why?', questioned Faelthys.</p>

          <p>
            'Many guards have families, who they understandably want to protect.
            It's part of the reason they joined the guard, aside from a naïve
            sense of duty.' The man's eyes rolled back in exasperated disdain,
            'But Bryad is different. He has a family, oh yes, but he wants more.
            He sees the power and the comforts of those with wealth, and he
            yearns for it. He doesn't want his legacy to remain pinned to a duty
            roster. I suspect he'd be willing to do many things for the sake of
            a heavier purse, or the favour of an influential individual.'
          </p>

          <p>'Has he taken bribes in the past?', this from Zyllana.</p>

          <p>
            'I know not, or you would too.' was the reply, 'But it would not
            surprise me. With Fortune's favour, he's on duty right now. For
            another three hours at least.'
          </p>

          <p>
            'Thank you. You've been most helpful, as always.', said Zyllana,
            inclining her head respectfully. The movement was mimicked by her
            two companions; the conversation was over. Anyone watching (although
            no-one uninvited would have been welcome), would have assumed to
            conclude with some payment, but the parties knew that compensation
            would be received in due time. A small gift arriving in the man's
            bedroom, or a particularly good offer at the local merchants for a
            day. Bags of coins were loud, and drew the attention of those with
            whom no-one wanted to be associated. People like Bryad.
          </p>

          <p>
            The pair made their way through the Lower City, passing merchants,
            peddlers, entertainers and craftsmen. Fumes hung thick in the air
            from a blacksmith's forge, mingling with the scent of freshly baked
            bread and tanning oils from the leather-makers across the square. It
            wasn't long before they reached CliffGate on the city's
            south-eastern road. Through the portcullis they could see the smoke
            rising from Tumbledown, with thatched roofs and iron-grey brickwork
            to the walls, nestled amongst the hills to the east.
          </p>

          <p>
            It didn't take long for them to find Bryad. The description they
            were given, along with all the Harpers' information, was accurate
            and detailed. Climbing the staircase to his post, Zyllana whispered
            to her companion, 'Let me try something.' Faelthys' face showed no
            sign he had heard, but he hung back a pace or so nevertheless.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bryad was a tall, reedy man with a messy head full of dark brown
            hair. His face was torn between watchful zealousness and indifferent
            boredom as the pair approached. 'Can I help you? Something wrong?'
          </p>

          <p>
            Zyllana, as ever, wasted no time. 'I'm afraid so. We're looking for
            a group of...travellers that came past this way. Individuals that
            would never have passed under your watchful eye, nor back out again.
            And yet somehow they did. Care to explain?'
          </p>

          <p>
            Bryad bristled. He was not used to such disrespect; his uniform saw
            to that. 'I don't know what you mean, and watch your tongue.'
          </p>

          <p>
            'Well then at least one of us would be on the lookout.' retorted
            Zyllana, placidly. 'Perhaps these individuals we seek made it worth
            your while? Perhaps you went home a few coins heavier that day,
            unless you spent them in the tavern over there.' Zyllana jerked her
            thumb over her shoulder to the building in question, a gaudy,
            raucous place. Its sign swung in the afternoon breeze, proclaiming
            its name as The Plaited Beard.
          </p>

          <p>
            'How dare you!', spat Bryad. 'I should have you locked up for making
            false accusations of the town guard!'
          </p>

          <p>
            'I wouldn't try, that would be embarassing for you and, more
            importantly, irritating for us.', came the reply. 'We need to find
            them. Where are they? Or shall we bring over your sergeant and see
            if they're anymore forthcoming?'. Zyllana's eyes glimmered with a
            dangerous calm, but Bryad seemed unmoved. His pride was stronger
            than his fear.
          </p>

          <p>
            'Like I said, I have no idea what you're talking about. Now piss off
            before <em>I</em> call the sergeant and have you taken away.' He
            turned his gaze back to the horizon with an arrogant sniff.
          </p>

          <p>
            Faelthys strode forward past his friend with a whisper. 'My turn.'
          </p>

          <p>
            Bryad didn't turn, but his eyes flickered towards Faelthys as he
            walked forward, before settling them back rigidly on the chimneytops
            of the nearby village.
          </p>

          <p>
            'Look, we're not here to get you into any trouble, and we don't
            really care about the...connections that you've made. We just want
            to know where a certain group have gone. My son, he... he was taken
            from me by wolves, two winters ago. A boy of only eight.'
          </p>

          <p>
            Bryad still did not look into the elve's eyes, but his face softened
            noticeably.
          </p>

          <p>
            'I won't bore you with my sob story, but all I have is his locket
            from when he was a baby. Someone stole it, and I think I know who.
            They went through this gate in the past few days, but that's my only
            lead. I have to find them, and before they sell it on. It's not
            worth much to anyone, but to me it's priceless, I'm sure you
            understand. Please, is there <em>anything</em> that you remember, or
            that you can tell us?'
          </p>

          <p>
            Bryad hesitated, a look of consternation shadowing his hardlined
            features. Eventually, he spoke. 'They're not far. Just near the
            road, half a day's ride in the forest.'
          </p>

          <p>
            'Thank you.' whispered Faelthys with a sigh of relief. He and
            Zyllana turned and strode away.
          </p>

          <p>
            'Do you mean to kill them?' called Bryad. The elves turned and
            looked at the guard. His lips were tightly pressed together; clearly
            he was only just managing to control himself.
          </p>

          <p>'Yes.' said Faelthys, simply.</p>

          <p>
            'Those bastards threatened my sister, I had no choice.' whispered
            the guardsman, 'Don't give them one either.'
          </p>

          <p>
            The pair stared levelly at the many for a few moments. After a small
            nod from Faelthys they strode wordlessly down the ramp to the town
            below. Behind them, the wind grasped at Bryad's tunic and silently
            wiped away the tear from his face.
