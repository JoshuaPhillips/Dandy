        <BannerText>As with all good tales, it began with a Gnommish smuggling ring...</BannerText>
        <p>
          Looking back, Zyllana thought it probably could have gone better. After all, it was supposed to be a routine
          reconnaissance assignment. <em>Get in. Gather intel. Get out.</em> Not something she, or any of her colleagues
          for that matter, would have considered a challenge. The gnomes were clearly up to something - how else could
          they have achieved such meteoric success in such a short space of time? Zyllana couldn't remember the last
          time she had seen so many Gnommish products flood the streets of Baldur's Gate, and if her memory served her
          correctly (and it always did), their last income streams hadn't exactly held the law in high regard, nor the
          safety of the general population.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, perhaps they'd learned something from experience after all. Zyllana's employer rarely went
          uninformed, but even the intelligence gathering capabilities of The Harpers had failed to acquire anything of
          value through the traditional methods. Hence why Zyllana and her colleagues were 'requested' to lend a helping
          hand.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, and inevitably, there were <em>complications</em> - as their mission report euphemistically
          attested. They always happened, and they were always dangerous. Part of the job was expecting the unexpected,
          and then being caught out and having to deal with it anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          The complications from this particular assignment were sitting across the table from her, nursing a fresh
          pewter tankard of a dark amber liquid that somehow reminded her simultaneously of freshly cut grass and the
          gutters they'd passed on the way in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ilro, for her part, seemed to be enjoying herself. Then again, Zyllana learned many years ago that a Druid's
          outward appearance was no reflection of their state of mind. She wondered vaguely if they had some metaphor to
          explain this away involving tree bark or something similarly saccharine, and watched the Half-Elf's pointed
          ears flicker slightly in the breeze as the oaken door to the tavern opened behind her, ushering in another
          group of travellers eager to rest their feet in the sun that streamed through the thin windows.
        </p>
        <p>
          'We should make a move soon.' said a deep voice to her right, resignation ringing in the words. The voice
          belonged to Anton, who slumped back as he spoke, as if to suggest that, his advice having been given, he could
          claim no responsibility for any lateness of the party, and could relax in peace once more. 'Don't want to keep
          Sendar waiting...' - this line cut off by a tip of the hat, obscuring his weathered face.
        </p>

        <p>
          'Once more, our contact's name is Syndra.' chided Zyllana, 'And I would advise that you get it right when we
          get there.'
        </p>

        <p>
          'Don't worry, this isn't my first assignment; I'm sure I'll dredge up my stale old airs and graces when the
          need arises.'
        </p>

        <p>
          'I'm sure. But yes, the time grows near. Before we go to the meeting, I must visit a merchant I know in the
          area; I have some purchases to make.' Zyllana's voice lowered a little as she spoke these words, and the group
          surrounding her nodded silently. Almost in unison, three of them stood up, followed shortly by Anton, after
          some rustling and murmuring from the brim of his hat. Zyllana stepped gracefully aside from the table, and was
          shortly joined by Anton, Ilro, and Faelthys - a fellow wood elf with whom Zyllana couldn't help but share a
          bond, despite the impersonal nature of their mutual employment. The group made their way back to the sun-lit
          streets, Ilro only pausing to drain her tankard before stepping through the threshold.
        </p>

        <Quest
          type='new'
          priority='main'

        />
        <SubTitle>Baldur's Gate - Merchant District</SubTitle>

        <p>
          Ilro's hand went up to her eyes, shielding them from the bright glare of the sun which glinted off the white
          stonework of the surrounding buildings. She marvelled again at the others' ability to acclimatise so quickly
          to the changes in light - she supposed that many months and years of exploring caves and dungeons and
          fortresses would have left them with a greater control of their vision, or perhaps they were just too proud or
          professional to show any discomfort.
        </p>

        <p>
          'Fuck it's bright.' exclaimed Anton, who had screwed up his eyes in discomfort. 'Told you we should have
          stayed inside.'
        </p>

        <p>
          'I get the feeling that's not why you wanted to stay.' retorted Faelthys, a wry smirk playing at the corners
          of his mouth. 'Somehow I feel that the waitress might have had something more to do with it.'
        </p>

        <p>
          Anton opened his mouth to reply, but was quickly cut off by a gentle but firm hand from Zyllana. 'Perhaps we
          should press on?' she suggested, gesturing across the road to a side street which teemed with shouting and the
          noise of the day's trading.
        </p>

        <p>
          The group continued on in various states of satisfaction. Ilro, still unaccustomed to the lively sensations of
          the merchant district, lagged slightly, desperate to peer into every shop window, every display cabinet, every
          market stall. Distracted, and with the hustle and bustle of the streets, she barely managed to keep up with
          the rest of the group. Fortunately both of her elven companions were easy to spot, and Anton's voice was{' '}
          <em>resonant</em> to say the least.
        </p>

        <Quote author='Zyllana, to Anton'>
          Once more, our contact's name is <em>Syndra</em>, and I would advise that you get it right when we get there.
        </Quote>

        <p>
          Quite suddenly, as if by some mutual understanding, they came to a halt. 'Our contact is waiting in this
          shop.', explained Faelthys. 'We may be a small while. Anton, I assume you'd rather be occupied elsewhere?'
        </p>

        <p>
          'What, or listen to you with your fancy words and secret eyebrow wiggling?', snorted Anton, 'I think I'll
          pass, thanks. I'll see what mischief I can get into at the docks. Coming Ilro?'
        </p>

        <p>
          All three turned to look at the druid, who hesitated slightly. 'Umm...in complete honesty, perhaps the docks
          isn't the best place for me Anton. I may or may not know some people there that I wouldn't exactly be pleased
          to see me.' Her pulse quickened as she spoke - although she had quickly impressed her new colleagues with her
          skills against the gnomes, she was aware that they weren't the type to trust too easily, and she didn't want
          to mess up her chances of the closest thing she'd had to a fresh start in a long time. And she did owe them a
          debt, after all...
        </p>

        <p>
          'Suit yourself, I'll leave the elves to their secrets.' mused Anton, marching off down the hill, where the
          glimmering sheen of the Chiontar was speckled with seagulls and far-off fishing ships.
        </p>

        <PartySplit>
          <PartySplitSection characters={['Zyllana', 'Faelthys', 'Ilro']}>
            <p>
              The door swung soundlessly on its hinges as the elven trio stepped lightly into the dimly lit shop.
              Clearly the entrance was in good repair, contrary to many of the surrounding buildings, and the skills of
              the owner were exactly why they had come here.
            </p>
            <p>
              The walls gleamed with freshly sharpened swords, daggers with intricate patterns gilded into the handles,
              and a few hefty-looking morningstars which threatened to draw blood at the slightest touch.
            </p>

            <p>
              Behind the low, wooden counter stood a stout, muscular man with cropped, auburn hair and a beard
              glistening with jewellery and semi-precious stones. He wore a heavy black apron over a smoke-stained white
              tunic, and, glancing briefly at his three new customers, set aside the dagger he was inspecting, carefully
              laying it upon a silken cloth.
            </p>

            <p>
              'Good afternoon!' he said, in a bright, cheery voice that was born of years of practice. 'What brings you
              to Merdor's humble workshop today? Come in, come in!'. He beckoned with a large, calloused hand before
              folding his arms and beaming as Zyllana and Faelthys approached him. Ilro had once again become enthralled
              with the glimmer of the merchandise, earning an approving smile from the owner.
            </p>

            <p>
              'Good afternoon. I was hoping that you might sell me some specialist supplies.' said Zyllana politely.
              After a quick, casual glance around the shop, she continued 'A trickster fooled me once, and I'd prefer it
              didn't happen again.'
            </p>

            <p>
              An ordinary passerby might have thought this a strange turn of phrase, even for an elf. Faelthys, however,
              having taken up a casual lean against the counter, smiled slightly as he recognised the meaning woven into
              his colleague's speech. The language of the Harpers' cant was among the first things he had been taught,
              all those years ago. After all, <em>'One can never have too much information.'</em>
            </p>

            <p>
              A flicker of recognition passed across the merchant's face, and the practised smile vanished. However, his
              manner remained polite and professional as he pulled a small silver key from a chain around his neck and
              inserted it into a small opening in the side of the counter top.
            </p>

            <p>
              The entire shop reverberated with a satisfying <em>thunk</em> as Merdor turned the key. He reached beneath
              the counter and hefted a shallow wooden tray into view. The items inside were arranged with painstaking
              precision, and were clearly flawlessly crafted, just like his regular wares.
            </p>

            <p>
              Faelthys turned to look at the new additions to the shop's stock. He recognised piles of coins from remote
              areas or unusual currencies, worth less than the fabric on which they rested. He saw leather cases filled
              with coloured powders and waxes - perfect for replacing one's face with another. Finally, he saw a small,
              leather wallet, folded in the middle, hidden away in one corner of the box. It was this pouch which
              Zyllana reached for with a graceful hand, opening it up upon the counter.
            </p>

            <p>
              Inside the pouch were several thin, sharp metallic objects, each nestled inside their own leather holster.
              Across the top lay a slightly thicker metal bar, bent ninety degrees at one end, square and flat. Although
              Faelthys had not had much need for such equipment, he knew that the same could not be said of his
              companion.
            </p>

            <p>
              'Twenty-five gold pieces for the set, case included.' said Merdor flatly. For a short while, neither elf
              responded. Then, Zyllana's crisp voice broke the silence. 'Fifteen.'
            </p>

            <p>
              'You know that's not even close to reasonable. I could cut it down to twenty, given your employer's
              previous help. Final offer. I've got a workshop to maintain, not to mention keeping stuff like this
              doesn't exactly leave me risk-free.'
            </p>

            <p>
              Faelthys didn't move his gaze from the tray as he whispered 'I'm sure we could find the rest, or come back
              after speaking to our contact?'
            </p>

            <p>'Perhaps.', admitted Zyllana, 'but alternatively... Ilro, have you your coin purse with you?'</p>

            <p>The half-elf turned with an inquisitive look. 'Yes, right here. Why? Do you need something?'</p>

            <p>
              'Could you see your way to parting with five gold pieces? I assure you it would be paid back in full. I
              hate to ask, but the purchase is important.'
            </p>

            <p>
              'Of course. No problem.' replied Ilro, reaching down to a cloth drawstring bag tied tightly around her
              waist. Zyllana did the same at her own belt, dropping her purse deliberately on the counter. 'Thank you. I
              trust this will be sufficient?' - this last question directed at Merdor, who was looking at the group with
              a confused expression.
            </p>

            <p>
              The blacksmith weighed the pouch thoughtfully in his hand, as well as counting the five shining coins from
              Ilro. 'Aye, that'll do nicely.' he said finally. 'Anything else?' The professionalism and friendliness in
              his tone was nowhere to be found anymore; he'd had enough.
            </p>

            <p>
              'That's quite enough, thank you for your help.' placated Faelthys, strolling calmly towards the door.
              Zyllana and Ilro gave Merdor only a smile before joining their partner on the street outside, and they
              were away before the tinkling of the bell had finished resounding through the newly deserted shop.
            </p>
          </PartySplitSection>
          <PartySplitSection characters={['Anton']}>
            <p>
              Anton admired the sheen on his boots as he strode confidently down the hill. The fresh air felt good on
              his face, and the sun was just at that point in the afternoon where the Chiontar became the golden jewel
              of Baldur's Gate. He loved the spring.
            </p>

            <p>
              Walking at an easy pace, the sounds of mid-afternoon labour filled his ears. The gentle lapping of water
              on wooden piers, the resonant clang of a ship's bell as it departed with its cargo, the swearing and
              general ruckus of the sailor-folk, sweating under the heat and humidity as they lifted barrels of spices
              and mead, crates of shiny, tanned leather and freshly-caught fish.
            </p>

            <p>
              His journey took him to a warehouse he knew well, having raided it a few times under the guise of a fellow
              sailor. Fortunately, unlike Ilro, Anton was careful to maintain a discreet approach when skirting with the
              law, or the wrath of the dock-workers.
            </p>

            <p>
              The men did not look up as he approached - strangers were not unwelcome, but rarely expected. Anton
              recognised them from a few local taverns that he'd frequented, but didn't remember meeting any of them.
              Though that didn't necessarily mean he hadn't; Anton was still sure that his last drink had been topped up
              without his knowing...
            </p>

            <p>
              'Evening gentlemen.' he greeted them, extracting from his coat pocket a long, narrow wooden pipe. 'Don't
              suppose any of you has a match?'
            </p>

            <p>
              The group looked at each other, before one of them reached into his own trouser pocket and dropped a
              nearly empty box of cheap matches on the crate around which they stood. 'Help yourself.' came his voice,
              much higher than Anton was expecting. He knew better than to smile.
            </p>

            <p>
              'Much obliged.' Anton struck a match on the first try, and put the flame to the bowl of his pipe. Within a
              few second the dry tobacco was crackling with a thick, dark smoke. 'What's mine is yours.' he said,
              proffering the newly lit pipe the group.
            </p>

            <p>
              The tallest of the group nodded appreciatively to Anton, and took a long, slow draw on the pipe, exhaling
              a serviceable smoke ring from between the greying whiskers of a curly black beard. He passed the pipe back
              with another curt nod, and a brief but not uncomfortable silence settled on the group.
            </p>

            <p>
              'So lads, what are your thoughts on this new Death Curse that's been plaguing the city?' Anton tried to
              make the question sound casual, and was slightly relieved to see that his companions didn't seem put out
              by the question. ''s obvious, innit?', replied the tallest once more. 'Gods're angry. 's not right, no it
              ain't.'
            </p>

            <p>
              The rest of his colleagues nodded in agreement. 'No, definitely not right.' concurred Anton. '...what
              exactly isn't right?'
            </p>

            <p>
              'The priests, of course.' objected the one to the right of matchbox owner. 'They're up there all day and
              night, bringing ou' innocent souls from their resting places and tetherin' 'em here again, where they
              don't belong. 's why they can't do it to none of the sick. The Gods don't want it no more.'
            </p>

            <p>
              Anton raised his eyebrows in surprise; he'd heard many rumours and theories behind the affliction that had
              wrapped itself around the city, but no-one had so far blamed the priests. He supposed the theory did have
              some merit, but he wasn't particularly one for superstition, or those that practiced it.
            </p>

            <p>
              'But surely the priests are just trying to help. I mean, if the Gods should favour anyone, it's them, no?
              You don't know any more about it?' Anton cursed silently as he spoke - had he pushed it too far?
            </p>

            <p>
              The tall sailor spat a thick wad of tarry black saliva on the wooden-slatted floor. 'Nobody knows. Best
              you just keep your 'ead down and stay away from any...re-anima'ed.' Anton could have sworn he saw a
              shudder roll through the shoulders of the sailor, despite the shining sun.
            </p>

            <p>
              'Yes, perhaps best.' he agreed, thoughtfully. 'Ah well, thanks for your time.' He passed the pipe back to
              the man, who drew another fortifying breath before returning it, his gaze never moving from the far shore
              of the lethargic river.
            </p>

            <p>
              Anton wished he had been paying more attention, as he could see that the bowl of the pipe, now empty, was
              smeared with a thick, dark substance - a generous gift from the sailor's labour. From the smell, he didn't
              think it was mud...
            </p>

            <p>
              With a final nod of farewell, he strode back up the road to return to his companions, feeling frustrated
              at the fruitless nature of his visit.
            </p>
          </PartySplitSection>
        </PartySplit>

        <p>
          'You've got shit on your shoes.' chuckled Ilro as Anton drudged his way back up the hill towards them. 'Have
          fun at the docks?'
        </p>

        <p>
          'Nothing to report. Let's just head to Syndra's.' came the muttered reply, and the group headed east through
          the merchant district, led by Faelthy's unwavering sense of direction.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Silvane Estate was hard to miss - sprawling gardens with perfectly trimmed hedges, sparkling water
          features and ornate, delicate masonry adorning the windows and large doorway. Anton let out a low whistle of
          appreciation as they climbed the white stone staircase towards the front door. 'Syndra seems to be doing
          alright for themselves. That bodes well for us.'
        </p>

        <p>
          'I must admit, it does indicate a more...comfortable lifestyle.' came Zyllana's levelled answer. The group
          reached the top of the stairs, and were faced with a large redwood door, in the centre of which hung a large,
          brass door handle. Ignoring it, Zyllana raised a closed fist and rapped lightly on the wood, three times in
          quick succession, and waited.

          Some shuffling movements could eventually be heard, and the wooden door creaked open to reveal a well-tailored
          servant in a dark dress shirt and matching trousers. His face was courteous, but not precisely welcoming; Ilro
          presumed this was not a place where lavish parties were frequently held.

        <p>The man spoke in a low drawl. 'May I help you?'.</p>

        <p>'We come to meet with Syndra Silvane.' pronounced Faelthys. 'They're expecting us.'</p>

        <p>
          The servant's face was expressionless. 'Of course they're expecting you.' he droned, stepping aside to let the
          party through the threshold. The group walked in to a magnificent entrance hall, adorned with gold-framed
          paintings, painstakingly crafted maps and lavish furniture. Anton resisted the urge to whistle again.

        <p>'This way, follow me.'</p>

        <p>
          They were led through an archway to the right of the front door, into a room dominated by a large,
          wrought-iron spiral staircase. The steps were perfectly arranged and showed not a hint of degradation, and the
          railings were polished to an incredible sheen. The servant walked briskly up the stairs and the party
          followed, all trying their best to maintain professionalism and not be swept up, or repulsed with the
          grandiose design.

          At the top of the stairs was a short, narrow corridor. It featured no windows and only one door. It was to
          this that Syndra's servant led them, and after needlessly brushing down his perfectly ironed shirt, he rapped
          on the door, the sound mimicking exactly that of Zyllana's knock not minutes before. The voice from within was
          faint and husky, but resonated with a strange confidence.
